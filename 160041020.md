Composite Design Pattern definition:

Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern and describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

In this village design pattern example village is a global composite object. The village has house, tree and WaterSource. This is a two levels of hierarchy.

Structured objects are used to build house, tree and WaterSource, which is the second level of hierarchy.

-> House is a composite of square and rectangle
-> Tree is a composite of cylinder and circle
-> WaterSource is a composite of cylinder and circle

All the shapeNames are independent to each other. The main advantages are:

-> Village is a composite of house, tree and waterSource and it acts independently of the other leaf nodes
-> Despite being composite objects, house, tree and waterSource are also independent of village and the other leaf nodes
-> The structured objects are also independent of the composite objects

Explanation of code:

-> Shape interface has a method called howShapeType()
-> Both Structures and Complex classes implement the shape interface and override the method showShapeType() of their parent class. Structures have square, rectangle, circle and cylinder objects and Complex have house, tree and waterSource objects
-> Composite class has an ArrayList called shapeNames of type Shape because Complex object can have two or more Complex shapeNames. Using addShape() method shapeNames are added to the list. Enhanced for loop is used to print as Complex shape has two or more Complex shapeNames
-> To make the hierarchy Structures and Complex shapeNames has been created in the main class
